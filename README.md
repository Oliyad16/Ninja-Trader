# Ninja Trader Automation

This project provides a set of automated trading strategies, indicators, and supporting scripts for the NinjaTrader platform. It aims to streamline the workflow for traders who want to develop, backtest, and deploy algorithmic trading systems for futures, forex, and equities.

## Features

- **Automated Strategies**: Custom C# scripts that generate signals, manage positions, and execute trades in real-time.
- **Indicators & Alerts**: Technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, stochastic, Keltner channels) and alerting mechanisms to identify trade setups.
- **Backtesting & Optimization**: Tools and configurations to run historical tests, optimize parameters, and evaluate performance metrics like profit factor and drawdown.
- **Risk Management**: Includes features like stop-loss, take-profit, and trailing stops to help mitigate risk.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine.
2. Open NinjaTrader 8 and import the `.zip` file from **Tools** > **Import** > **NinjaScript**.
3. Navigate to **Strategies** in NinjaTrader to find and enable the newly imported strategies.
4. Adjust parameters (e.g., timeframes, stop/target sizes) to suit your trading style.
5. **Backtest** and **Optimize** in the Strategy Analyzer to fine-tune settings.

## Requirements

- NinjaTrader 8 (latest version recommended)
